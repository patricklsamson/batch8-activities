# Front-End Activity 4: Survey Form

This activity is about creating HTML forms and how they work in collecting info from users.

It consists of different pages:

1. The index [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a4-survey-form/index.html) wherein you will be directed to the survey form.
1. The results landing [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a4-survey-form/results.html) wherein you just fill up what's required and then you will be redirected to this page. This page also contains a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFzkbos0oeo) to a youtube video featuring a cinematic trailer of League of Legends: Wild Rift.
