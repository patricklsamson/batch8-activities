            <h1>The Complete Guide in Lazy Loading Images</h1>

            <p>The purpose of lazy loading is not to load resources or images especially the high resolution ones immediately but rather load them later on when needed. This technique makes web pages load faster as the loading reduces the number of images to be loaded right up away within the page thus also boosting the performance of the web page.</p>

            <p>As a website administrator, you can also save up money by using this technique rather than relying on a bunch of cloud hosting services such as Content Delivery Networks (CDN), storages, and etc. Maintaining your web page to be hosted already hurts the wallet!</p>
