# Front-End Activity 11: API Final Project - Psychally

This activity is about creating an app of our choice while observing the usage of public API and all the things we have learned so far in JavaScript. The purpose of this app is to boost awareness on mental health.

It consists of different pages:

1. The index [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a11-api-final-project/index.html). This page is meant to spread awareness about mental health for all people whether they are mentally struggling or not, or someone they know that is mentally struggling.
1. The admin [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a11-api-final-project/admin.html). This page's link can be found at the footer of the index page of the app and can be accessed with the username and password "admin" respectively. Upon log in, initial data will be loaded automatically for testing purposes or you can also press the "sync" button above the table. This page also shows all data passed from the "SOS" section of the index page of the app.

Notes:

- Local storage was used for this activity and that would mean all data will always be available inside your browser's local storage even if you close your browser. To clear up everything inside the local storage, please refer to this [link](https://intercom.help/scoutpad/en/articles/3478364-how-to-clear-local-storage-of-web-browser). Aside from that, I have also provided delete or "trash can" buttons that will also automatically delete data from the local storage.
