                Due to the COVID-19 outbreak by the end of 2019, the whole world
                was greatly affected. The economy went down. Many companies and
                businesses broke down, especially aviation and tourism. Scarcity
                of resources and other various problems have risen, it changed
                all people's way of life. But there is also one thing that we
                should watch and be aware about, our mental health.

                Almost all people focused on how to rise up and survive. But
                little did they know, these people or the ones around them or
                close to them can be or were already mentally struggling. They
                don't have that much time to be aware of their mental health and
                just tend to put it aside, how much more if we neglected those
                people who were already mentally struggling even before the
                pandemic started. And that is the worst thing that can happen.
                Fear, worry, anxiety, and stress, those things are normal
                reponses during this time especially of what we are hearing from
                the news everyday and we should know how to properly cope with
                these things up. We should also know how to properly assess
                ourselves or the ones around us of what we all needed mentally.
                We should properly understand the significance of mental health
                awareness and especially the mentally struggled ones already
                close to us that we should care for them.
