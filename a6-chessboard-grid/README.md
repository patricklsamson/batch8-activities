This activity is about creating another chessboard but using CSS grid.

It consists of different pages:

1. The index [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a6-chessboard-grid/index.html) wherein you will be directed to a "Continue last saved game?" selection page.
1. From the index page, you will be redirected to the [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a6-chessboard-grid/chess-midgame.html) featuring the middle game of the chess when you prompted "Yes". This page contains a story to know what chess pieces are movable by just clicking them that can also be opened on a new tab or page ([link to the story](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a6-chessboard-grid/story.html)).
1. You will be redirected to the [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a6-chessboard-grid/chess-newgame.html) featuring the new game of the chess when you prompted otherwise.
