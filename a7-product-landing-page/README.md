# Front-End Activity 7: Product Landing Page

This activity is about creating product landing page and serves as the final project for the HTML and CSS part of the front-end. The product I chose to feature was Acer Predator Triton 500.

It consists of different pages:

1. The index [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a6-chessboard-grid/index.html) wherein you will be directed to the product I will be featuring.
1. The log in landing [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a7-product-landing-page/login-landing-page.html) wherein there's really no validation at all. Just following the right way to fill up HTML input type of email with the use of "@" and putting any characters in the password will redirect you to this page.
1. You sign up landing [page](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a7-product-landing-page/signup-landing-page.html). Just like the Survey Form activity, just fill up what's required and you will be redirected to this page.

Notes:
- There are external links I used to fill up the footer of this activity with reference to the actual links of the Acer Predator website.
- This whole activity especially its functionalities were made up of pure CSS as much as possible. I just injected some support of js to make it more functional.
- The carousel was pure javascript and referenced from the [code](https://github.com/fionnachan/fifi-Slider/blob/master/fifi_slider.js) of Fionna Chan. I made a few tweaks to add an autoplay function based from her code.
- This activity also serves as a gate as we enter JavaScript. Such as injecting a simple JavaScript function like alert, and in my case, an alert will pop up when you clicked the log in button from the index page.
