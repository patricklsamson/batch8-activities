# Front-End Activity 3: Tribute Page

This activity is about creating a tribute page for someone I look up to, while following a set of user stories. User stories are often written by clients, users, and etc. I am tributing this page for Timothy John Berners-Lee.

You can access the page via this [link](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a3-tribute-page-project/index.html). It also has a [link](https://webfoundation.org/about/sir-tim-berners-lee/) to the article describing more about the inventor of World Wide Web and the director of the World Wide Web Consortium.
