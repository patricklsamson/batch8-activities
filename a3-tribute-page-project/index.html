            Having invented the Web in 1989 while working at CERN and
            subsequently working to ensure it was made freely available to all,
            Berners-Lee is now dedicated to enhancing and protecting the web’s
            future. He is a Founding Director of the World Wide Web Foundation,
            which seeks to ensure the web serves humanity by establishing it as
            a global public good and a basic right. He is also Director of the
            World Wide Web Consortium, a global web standards organisation he
            founded in 1994 to lead the web to its full potential. In 2012 he
            co-founded the Open Data Institute (ODI) which advocates for Open
            Data in the UK and globally. Sir Tim has advised a number of
            governments and corporations on ongoing digital strategies. A
            graduate of Oxford University, Sir Tim presently holds academic
            posts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at CSAIL
            (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab), (USA) and the
            University of Oxford (UK).
