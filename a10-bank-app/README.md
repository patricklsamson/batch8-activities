# Front-End Activity 10: Bank App

This activity is about creating a bank app and its main focus is the usage of JavaScript Class. I named the bank "Banco de Triase".

You can access the page via this [link](https://patricklsamson.github.io/batch8-activities/a10-bank-app/index.html).

Notes:
- Local storage was used for this activity and that would mean all data will always be available inside your browser's local storage even if you close your browser. To clear up everything inside the local storage, please refer to this [link](https://intercom.help/scoutpad/en/articles/3478364-how-to-clear-local-storage-of-web-browser). Aside from that, I have also provided delete or "trash can" buttons that will also automatically delete data from the local storage.
- As you access the page, you will be directed to a log in page. The default username and password to be able to get in is "admin" respectively. Because of local storage, the admin privilege will automatically be available anytime.
- After logging in using admin, there is a download button beside the heading "Bank Accounts", that will load initial data into the local storage for immediate testing purposes.
- "JANE HILLS DOE" also has a log in account automatically that can be accessed with the username and password "janedoe" respectively. While the rest needs to be signed up first with their account names and bank accounts should strictly match.
- Everything you see inside the app are working up to the settings wherein you can change data from the admin up to each users you make or the initial data loaded in the local storage.
